# Covid-19 timeseries data analysis in Ethiopia

This project is just a simple trial on COVID-19 timeseries data analysis in Ethiopia. The ultimate goal is to have a structured timeseries data for further analysis using advanced data science approaches and prediction models. 
Anyone who is interested to explore more in this regard can continue using existing data and simple trials.
For beginners who are passionate about python libraries; I strongly advise to use an interactive Jupyter notebook. Thus, you can import this file to jupyter notebook and the CSV files. If yoou wish to work on colab you may need to upload the dataset using "from google.colab import files" library.
More questions and collaborations would be appreciated. Just in case Email: ephe11ta@gmail.com
